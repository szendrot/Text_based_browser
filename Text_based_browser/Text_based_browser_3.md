Description
Every browser has a “back” button. If the user presses this button, the browser shows the previous web page. This feature can be implemented using a stack. This will allow the browser to save the pages visited by the user – google, wikipedia, bloomberg, … – but when the user types back, you will see the pages in the reverse order – … bloomberg, wikipedia, google.

Objectives
The result of this task is the same as in the previous one, but now the program has a new feature:

The program should show the previous web page saved to a file if the user types back. Note that the last page you saved to a file is actually the current page; when the user types back, you should output the page that was before the current one. You can implement a stack to do this, but note that the current page should not be in that stack. For example, if the user inputs bloomberg.com, then nytimes.com, and then back, the user should see the content of bloomberg.com.
If there are no more pages in the browser history, don’t output anything. For example, if the first input of the user is the string back, your program shouldn't output anything.
Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
